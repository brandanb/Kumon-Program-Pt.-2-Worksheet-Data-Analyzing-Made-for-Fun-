# Kumon-Program-Pt.-2-Worksheet-Data-Analyzing-Made-for-Fun-
Program used in conjunction with my pt. 1 program to get certain statistics from recorded worksheet data including: total worksheets completed, total average, worksheets completed per subject, subject average, worksheet completed per level, and level averages. It also has a fairly user friendly UI.
